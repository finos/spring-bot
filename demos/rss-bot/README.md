# RSS Bot

This provides a simple bot that is able to publish RSS news articles into a chatroom, by consuming RSS feeds.  The RSS feeds are configurable by the members of the room.  As usual, type /help to get the bot to provide help information.  This is standalone, and just requires `application.yml` to run.
