# Demo To-Do Bot

This provides a "todo list" bot in Symphony, which is covered in the [Tutorial](../../tutorials/Chat-Workflow.md).

If you don't want to go through the tutorial and assemble the code yourself, you can download this instead and build it on your desktop. 

This Bot will help to capture the To-Do task. And it flag what task is not completed.
