# Demo Bot

This provides a very simple bot in Symphony, which is covered in the [Tutorial](../../tutorials/Spring-Boot-Bot.md).

If you don't want to go through the tutorial and assemble the code yourself, you can download this instead and build it on your desktop.

You will need to provide settings for the `application.yml` file according to your own environment.
