# Room Bot

This really simple bot allows anyone to send a message into a room that the bot belongs to, anonymously.  

Use-cases similar to this were needed for tools to allow mental-health first-aiders to talk anonymously to their clients using Symphony.   

When you run this bot on teams and symphony, this is a nice example of how Spring Bot is platform-agnostic.
