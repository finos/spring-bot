## Configuration

### Override the Welcome Message

```

  reminder:
    welcomeMessage:  "The reminder bot is active in this room.   Type a date or time in your conversation and I'll create a reminder for it" 
    
```

### Set the Default TimeZone

By default, time-zone is set to london, but you can override with any Java timezone like so:

  reminder:
    defaultTimeZone:  "America/Los_Angeles" 
    
```
