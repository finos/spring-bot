###Â Set Remind-Before

By default, if you chat to the bot "Remind me to go to town at 8pm" you'll get a reminder at 8pm.  You can change the exact time of the reminder when you create 

However, if you want your reminders _earlier_ by default you can configure this site-wide for the bot:

``` 
symphony:
  reminder:
    defaultRemindBefore:  30  # 30 minutes before.
```
updating remindbefore can be achieved by :

/remindbefore 5
