32. Allow buttons on thymeleaf display versions.
33. fix coverage so that it works cross-project
34. merge changes from master

30.  Make welcome listener generic teams and symph.  move to chat-workflow.

37.  Userlist is only needed when in edit mode.

7.  Convert keys to values with dropdowns/enums/users in view mode
