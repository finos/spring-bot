DEV TASKS

26. Fix the Bots : 
 - Reminder: just need to get the list of chats working
 - News, 
 - PollBot:  we need to use updating posts for this.
38. HelpPage reference in *ChatHandlerMapping, also buttons with parameters??
32. Allow buttons on thymeleaf display versions.
33. fix coverage so that it works cross-project
35. Reading writing azure blob with tag in conversation.  
	- Also write disk version. 
	- Still some issue here. (is there? - need ITs, maybe update library?.  ok, this WILL FAIL if there is no match, some deserialization issue)

symphony- submit bug report for messagebuilder
teams - request gets sent multiple times

RELEASE PROCESS

- Rename project in Github (arrange meeting this week).
- Can we release the project into maven central with the new groupId?
- Tutorials: ToDo and claim tutorials - make them work with both (Teams takes priority).
- domain name
- article about no code/low code.


OTHER MINOR ISSUES SPOTTED

 - Userlist is only needed when in edit mode.
 - We need the concept of 'me' in teams - you can't mention yourself!
 - dropdown picker seems to revert to the original user? (teams)


SURESH ?

20. Build time editors / viewers (both symphony and teams)
36. Cash Tag/HashTag editor/viewer (symphony)


AFTER RELEASE

- Rework leader election so that it is platform agnostic.  Also, reinstate this back into reminder bot.   DELETE THIS.
