14. Saving templates (GH Ticket)
18. Client-side validation (GH Ticket)
25.  Fix Coverage

1. Convert KoreAI, TeamCity and Maven Build Reporter to use Chat Workflow instead. (maybe)
20. Build time editors / viewers (both symphony and teams)

- We need the conversation API for this.  And to figure out the history API.

7.  Convert keys to values with dropdowns/enums/users in view mode 
	 - this needs the original options list to be present (I think).   
 	 - Also, we need to know what the option was populated with.  This can be done.
	 
21.  handle tennant id	
22.  thymeleaf templating
23.  auto-generate manifest?
26.  Fix the Bots : ToDo, Claim Bot, News, Demo etc.
