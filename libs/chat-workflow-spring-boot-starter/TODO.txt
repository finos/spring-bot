1.  Figure out EntityJsonConverter - needs to have version for Symphony
3.  SymphonyResponseHandler - needs to handle templates properly.
4.  We need to convert Message -> MessageML string.  
6.  Adopt Spring's error handling / ThreadLocal / Author -> Action.  
7.  Missing parameters - remove code that does this.
