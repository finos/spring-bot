# THE SYMPHONY JAVA CLIENT PROJECT

## COMPANY CONTRIBUTOR LICENCE AGREEMENT ("CCLA")

Thank you for your interest in the Symphony Java Client Parent project
(the "Project"). The Project is an open source software initiative
operated by Deutsche Bank AG, acting through its London branch (the
"Operator") which has the aim providing tooling for Java Symphony
developers.

In order to clarify the intellectual property licence granted with
contributions from any company, the Project must have a CCLA on file
that has been signed by, or on behalf of, each company contributor,
indicating agreement to the licence terms below ("Company
Contributor").

This licence is for your protection as a Company Contributor as well as
the protection of the Project and its users; it does not affect your
rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

This version of the CCLA allows a Company Contributor to submit
contributions to the Project and to grant copyright and patent licences
thereto.

Please read this CCLA carefully before accepting its terms. By accepting
the CCLA, you are agreeing to bind the Company Contributor to its terms.
If you want to accept this CCLA, please complete and send a scanned copy
of an original signed CCLA to the Operator at 
**Deutsche Bank AG 1 Great Winchester Street EC2N 2DB LONDON GREAT BRITAIN** 
marked for the attention of the Project representative. Please keep a copy of the
signed CCLA or your records.

Alternatively please accept through CLA-Assistant on GitHub.

For the purposes of this Project, the Project representatives are: 
**Mark Mainwood and Robert Moffat**.
